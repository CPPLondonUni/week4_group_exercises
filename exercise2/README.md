Exercise 2
----------

A [Caesar shift cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
works by *shifting* each letter of the alphabet by a given number of places.

For example, a shift of two places will replace

```
A with C
B with D, 
C with E,
...
W with Y,
X with Z,
Y with A,
X with B
```

Your task is to implement the functions in `exercise2.cpp` to build up to
implementing a Caesar shift cipher for arbitrary strings.
